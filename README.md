# Project Title

## Description of the Project
This is a simple Java console application meant to be a simulator for an e-store.
The users are allowed to view available products, manage a shopping cart, and checkout.
Users can also follow these steps:
1. Users can browse the selection of available items.
2. Users can add or remove products from their cart.
3. Users can finalize their transactions.

## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application.
- As a user, I want to have a user-friendly products display screen, so that I can easily view all available items and their details.
- As a user, I want to receive a confirmation message after adding a product to my cart, so that I can know the action was successful.
- As a user, I want to have the option to remove items from my cart easily, so that I can manage my selections before checkout.
- As a user, I want to see the total amount in my cart clearly, so that I can understand my expenses before making a purchase.
